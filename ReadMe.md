# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
This is a showcase on how PCA is used for dimensionality reduction. Putting aside non-essential dimensions, especially for the case of big datasets, helps programmers and data scientists to work with data in a more efficient way.  
Employing PCA, this code tries to find important principal components of images provided in `Database` as a whole and by omitting insignificant features it attempts to reduce its size.  

# Usage 🛠️
✔️ After installing required python libraries by entering
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
into a terminal, the program can easily start with 
`python PCA_Showcase.py`.  
✔️ Also you can play around with variables like the number of Eigen vectors to keep to get more insight into PCA.  

# Output 🗜️
![An image from Database and its corresponding Output](/Figures/Figure-2.jpg "An image from Database and its corresponding Output")
![An image from Database and its corresponding Output](/Figures/Figure-3.jpg "An image from Database and its corresponding Output")
